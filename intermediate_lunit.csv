Comparison was made with the previous study dated 24 Jan 2023.

There is complete whiteout of the left hemithorax with ipsilateral mediastinal and tracheal deviation. This is compatible with left lung collapse. Left pulmonary mass needs to be excluded.

The right lung is largely clear with compensatory hyperinflation. No right sided effusion is seen.
The heart size is not accurately assessed.

CT thorax is recommended for further evaluation.
